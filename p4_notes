- Analysis:
  - Daily patterns:
    - Monday-Friday peaks at 8am, 6pm
    - Thursday starts new peak around 10pm
    - Friday and Saturday peaks at 7pm and 10pm
  - Weekly patterns:
    - Ramps up Sunday-Saturday    
    - Saturday demand dips from night before then climbs
  - Monthly patterns:
    - Demand ramped up throughout the period, maybe due to:
      - Increase in popularity
      - Warmer weather (need more data to confirm)
  - Outliers (April, May and June 100k+)
    Possible Explanations:
      - April was normal
      - May 16: http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2015_traffic_2015_05_15.shtml
      - June 27: http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2015_traffic_2015_06_26.shtml
      - May 17-24 ridership pattern: something happened, not sure what.  Describe.  Create % change for that week
  - Other / unusual patterns:
    - Demand dips after a huge day, sometimes for a few days
    - Explain May weird finger 
    - 
- Recommendations:
  - Share data with drivers
    - This worked wonders for linkdin
    - Doesn't have to be all drivers if worried
      - Share with top-tier or longer tenured drivers
  - Encourage more festivals.  They cause the biggest increases in ridership
